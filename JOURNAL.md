# June 26th:
I worked on my CAD. I had to realyl think about how to design the finger. I decided to start off with some cylidners and then processeded to hollow them out, cut them, connect them, then add the plates with holes for a string (kevlar line) to go through all the fingers, so it can pull and curl the fingers.
I planned how I was going to design the whole finger and motion (sideways, and curling motion). I decided to use a string to curl the finger, by making a motor pull the string. For sideways movement, I will just use a servo motor probably.
