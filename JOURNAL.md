I worked on my CAD. I had to really think about how to design the finger. I decided to start off with some cylidners and then processeded to hollow them out, cut them, connect them, then add the plates with holes for a string (kevlar line) to go through all the fingers, so it can pull and curl the fingers.
I planned how I was going to design the whole finger and motion (sideways, and curling motion). I decided to use a string to curl the finger, by making a motor pull the string. For sideways movement, I will just use a servo motor probably.

I completely changed my cad and tried to model an actual finger. I found a reference iamge so I worked off based off of that. This took a lot of tiem because I had to also develop parts for the bendable parts fo the finger. I had to use many different shapes and in the images atached, there should be one that shows how many different shapes I had to carefully plan out.

I finished my CAD I think. I addee the hinges, I added the holes/guides for the kevlar string. I also added the holes for where I would connect the finger parts, and designed the tubes I need for that.

I just added the servo motor holder (it took some time designing the holder for the servo motor accurately and also its axle's shape stuff) and the spool I will need to the CAD. For my final CAD file, I will take the stuff apart and put them separate so that the 3D printer can actually properly 3D print stuff.

I designed the schematic for my robot finger/hand. I decided that all I will need is an ESP32-CAM module and a servo motor. So, I added those (it took some time to also add the symbol libraries and footprints too). I also realized I needed to add a capacitor as well. After runnign ERC, I received a few errors, so I fixed the unconnected pins with a No Connect end, and then also added the PWR_FLAGs. I was originally going to design a PCB too, but I realized that since it's just one finger, and also there may be some errors and refinning and testing and stuff, a PCB would take too long to make each time.
